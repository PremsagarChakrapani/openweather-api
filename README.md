# openweather-api
this a project done as a sample to understand api calls and how it happens in real time.
use your authorized api key in place of "apiKey" in script.js file.
though the html and css portion of the webpage is still under progress, the site is pretty functional.
i intend to all more weather details and also add a global clock on the webpage whic shows local time of the city/location entered
